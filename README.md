# medical-data-hypothesis-testing
Parametric and non-parametric probes for medical dataset.

This was a very short excercise.

The file Medical_data_MA2.sav contains data on cardiac patients who have been divided into three groups (A, B, C; variable "Csoport") according to the type of treatment used. Compare the three groups according to two laboratory data: creatinine (variable CREAT_0), potassium (variable K_0). Both values provide information (among others) on the functioning of the kidneys.
Compare the groups using the appropriate parametric and non-parametric tests and answer the questions below:
- Which tests did you choose and why?
- What are the results? Are they the same or not? Write a justification!
- Plot the distributions by group. (Try using a contour plot or other means to plot two-dimensional distributions by two variables. You may want to standardize the variables.)
